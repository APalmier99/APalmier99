Hi! I'm Anthony, welcome to my GitHub!! 

I'm a recent graduate from the Data Science master's program at the University of Padua, Italy, with a bachelor's degree in applied mathematics. 
Although almost everything seems to catch my attention, my major research interests center around Mathematical Optimization and Operations Research, with a particular emphasis on combinatorial optimization and data-driven optimization.

Being an applied math enthusiast, I'm also deeply intrigued by Machine Learning and Deep Learning, especially in emerging areas such as Neural Differential Equations and Physics-Informed Neural Networks.

When I'm not studying any of those things you’ll probably find me reading books, videogaming or vibing to Taylor Swift’s songs. I enjoy hiking and outdoors activities just as much as I
enjoy wearing an imaginary pointed hat and casting spells in D&D. Currently reading LOTR books!

In this GitHub you'll find everything I worked on so far, or at least anything worth posting. 
I'll publish here the projects I worked on as well as some of the most relevant assignments I received in these past years.

If you want to reach out to me just message me at ap.anthonypalmieri@gmail.com.
Have a good stay!
