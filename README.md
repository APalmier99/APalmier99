Hi! My name is Anthony, welcome to my GitHub!! 
I'm currently a graduate student at University of Padua (Italy), enrolled in the Master's degree "Mathematics of Data Science", 
trying to unveil the beautiful math underlying the Machine Learning world.
I also have a bachelor in Math, pursued in Padua as well, with focus on applied mathematics.

Although almost everything seems to catch my attention, my major interests are in: Operation Research and Mathematical
Optimization, Spectral Graph Theory, Measure Theory and Probability Theory, Mathematical Statistics,
Deep Learning, Unsupervised Learning.

When I'm not studying any of those things you’ll probably find me reading books,
videogaming or vibing to Taylor Swift’s songs. I enjoy hiking and outdoors activities just as much as I
enjoy wearing an imaginary pointed hat and casting spells in D&D. Currently reading LOTR books!

In this GitHub you'll find everything I worked on so far, or at least anything worth posting. 
I'll publish here the projects I worked on as well as some of the most relevant assignments I received in these past years.

If you want to reach out to me just message me at ap.anthonypalmieri@gmail.com.
Have a good stay!
