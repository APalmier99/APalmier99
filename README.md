Hi! I’m Anthony — welcome to my GitHub!

I’m a first-year PhD in Computational Mathematics at the University of Padua, where I work on stochastic optimization—especially derivative-free methods. My first project develops **stochastic direct search with extrapolation using dense directions**; my current work explores **stochastic active-set identification**.

Before the PhD, I was a research fellow at the **Italian Institute of Technology** (Armenise-Harvard Farabella Lab, Genoa), where I built a **stochastic sparse community-detection pipeline** for 3D chromatin imaging (SMLM) and contributed code to the lab’s in-house **CIMA** library. 

I earned an **MSc in Data Science (110/110 cum laude)** and a **BSc in Mathematics** from the University of Padua. My master’s thesis—**“Quantum Integer Programming for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem”**—tested both annealing and gate-based quantum algorithms (QAOA, VQE, GAMA) alongside classical Gurobi baselines; my bachelor’s thesis studied **community structure via the Stochastic Block Model**. 

On this GitHub you’ll find what I’m building: stochastic DFO experiments, notes and code for direct-search methods, quantum-optimization prototypes for VRP, and a few side projects (and past assignments) in network science and data analysis. If you like optimization you’re in the right place!

When I’m away from proofs and plots, I’m probably on a hike, buried in a medieval-fantasy book/videogame, or playing with my army of dogs and cats.
